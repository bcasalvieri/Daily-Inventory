        <li className='mb-2'>Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.</li>

        <li className='mb-2'>Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.</li>
        <li className='mb-2'>Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.</li>
        <li className='mb-2'>Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.</li>
        <li className='mb-2'>Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.</li>
        <li className='mb-2'>Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious contact with God, as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of His will for us and the power to carry that out.</li>
