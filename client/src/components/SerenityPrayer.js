        God, grant me the serenity <br/>
        to accept the things I cannot change, <br/>
        the courage to change the things I can, <br/>
        and the wisdom to know the difference. <br/>
        Living one day at a time, <br/>
        enjoying one moment at a time; <br/>
        accepting hardship as a pathway to peace; <br/>
        taking, as Jesus did, <br/>
        this sinful world as it is, <br/>
        not as I would have it; <br/>
        trusting that You will make all things right <br/>
        if I surrender to Your will; <br/>
        so that I may be reasonable happy in this life <br/>
        and supremely happy with You forever in the next. <br/><br/>
        Amen.
